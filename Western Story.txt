"Welcome to the West!" cried Harry, as he comes to lead your horse into town.

Slide 2
You slide into a booth at the local restaurant and order some food.
A sleek man with a large moustache and monacle, all dressed in black wants to speak with you.
He asks if you would like to be rich beyond your wildest dreams.
All you need to do is give him all the money you have and he will give you the keys to a gold mine.

Do you give the man all your money?

You awake in the night to the sound of shouting from the window. 
You throw open the shutters to see someone being thrown on the back of a horse by a masked bandit.
You could maybe save them if you act fast!
Then again, it could put you in a lot of danger.

What do you do?
Chase them
Go back to bed
